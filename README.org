* Status

** TODO add properties
- use properties to generate schedule

** TODO modifying action
- support (e)asy or (h)ard
- mark as DONE (but does not remove. We can change this status)
- modify master org file (this requires to maintain a link)
  - will the rest links be modified??

** TODO add refresh (g)
- regenerate review schedule
  - this should remove DONE entries automatically

* Introduction

There exists majorly two work, the =org-drill= and =pamparam=.

Org-drill is too complicated.
- It pops so many properties in the entries
- It requires :drill: markup for each entry, and each entry should
  have a question, and another subtree for storing answers

I don't like some design decisions of pamparam:
- Pamparam keeps the progress inside another directory system, version
  controlled. It is a neat idea, but I want to keep the (minimum)
  progress with the master org file itself.
- Also, Pamparam is generating one file for each card, resulting in
  far too many files.
- Seems it is designed to enter the answer and validate. There seems
  not to be a readily supported way to enter a score manually without
  typing the answer. Typing answer is of trouble because the answer
  might be super long, super complex, requiring invoking other input
  method (such as Chinese), and most importantly, typing is slow,
  thinking is fast.


That renders the feature of this project:
- keep minimum meta data within the master org file
- clean file structure: the header is the question, the rest is the
  answer
- only two score: yes or no, instead of 0-5
- org-agenda kind of interface
  - can show all or just show the due ones
  - status mark just in the list
